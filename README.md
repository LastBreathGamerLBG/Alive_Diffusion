# Alive_Diffusion😊😊
Alive Diffusion is a Stable Diffusion via code made easy by LBG with detailed  and easy steps.
Any one can use it without thinking or managing stuffs.


# Why Alive_Diffusion ?🤔🤔
After the ban of stable diffusion ATOMATIC 1111 webui in colab and lots of problems in kaggle.
I switch to stable diffusion via code not using webui, but this make my life hell because i was 
depanded on the other usere for colab and kaggle notbooks which was complex and for even loading
my fav model it become like a hell to edit code. so i made my own colab and kaggle notebooks 
which can run super easly and model changing is so easy. 


# For whom is these notbooks?🧐🧐

These notebooks are for those person who want full control over code. i have explain everything in these notbooks
it will kick start the journy of learning how to code stable diffusion and to gernate inmges very quickly.
